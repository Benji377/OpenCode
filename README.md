# OpenCode

## Welcome to OpenCode

This is a rather silly project without really any use or target.
There is just one file called main.py and if you like to you can create a pull-request and add your own code to it.
The code will then be reviewed and if accepted it will be added to the main.py file.

## There are a few rules to follow

1. No harmful code: Files with harmful code will be immediately denied
2. No code spamming: If your pull-request doesnt get accepted, please don't spam the code, it doesn't help.
3. Be respectful at all time
4. Follow Github rules and guidelines
5. Python3 only!
6. For everything else I forgot to say, please use common sense

### Here is a tutorial to help you: [create pull-requests properly](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-contribute-to-a-github-repository-project-78f777623f18)

## Requirements

The code is now requiring the following packages to be installed:

```shell
pyfiglet
```

### Have fun!

# OpenCode

## What is OpenCode?
OpenCode is an open Python project for everyone to contribute. It doesn't have a specific target and everyone can freely create a pull-request and add his own code to it. Hopefully in the future it will become a great app or something which can do a lot of things. I can't wait to see all your code ideas!

## Some rules:
1. No harmful code: Files with harmful code will be immediately denied
2. No code spamming: If your pull-request doesnt get accepted, please don’t spam the code, it doesn’t help.
3. Be respectful at all time
4. Follow Github rules and guidelines
5. Python only: Code should be written in Python3 only!
6. For everything else I forgot to say, please use common sense

## How do I participate?
To participate you need to meet the requirements listed below and have some basic knowledge about Github. You basically need to add your own code snippet to the "main.py" file. To do this you need to create a pull-request. If you don't know how to do that, don't worry, here is a [tutorial](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-contribute-to-a-github-repository-project-78f777623f18) to help you.

## Requirements:
- some basic knowledge about Github
- basic knowledge about Python3
- having some ideas for the OpenCode project
- be patient

## Additional notes:
This project has been made completely for fun. It is nothing serious and isn't aiming to become one, please keep that in mind while looking at the code which will probably become a total mess if a lot of people start to add their code. If you decide to contribute you can as always add your name to the contributor list as shown in the tutorial. 
With that said, I wish you a good day!
